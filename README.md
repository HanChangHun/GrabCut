# GrabCut

2019-winter Ajou Univ. Visual Computing Lab. Individual project

this is a python implementation of [GrabCut](http://cvg.ethz.ch/teaching/cvl/2012/grabcut-siggraph04.pdf).

implementation by python library(opencv-python, numpy, pyQt, sklearn)

I refer to this code.

I didn't put Border Matting in the Gui. Because Border Matting takes too much time. It's very slow maybe due to Python's computational speed problem.

you can run at command line :

$ python grabcut_qt.py
